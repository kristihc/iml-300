                <p class="text">Twitter has a self-evident design because a user has clear, concise button options, in addition to a search bar that has no specific structure.</p>

               <p class="text">Garden and Marks is a self-evident web design, as the user does not have to think of what to search, since the navigation options are kept to a minimum. Also, even without knowing what this website is, one could very easily navigate it.</p>

                <p class="text">The myAlaska web site has a variety of related links dispersed in unrelated sections of the site. There is no search bar to direclty look up what you need. Additionally, the titles of links are often very long and unnecessarily descriptive.</p>

               <p class="text">Coursera has a user friendly design, but is tasked with guiding students and users through a non-traditional learning platform as well as unfamiliar material and resources. For this reason, no matter how straigtforward they try to make their website design, there is always an element of having to guide the user. </p>
